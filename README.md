# materialize

We (Noah Yarian, Katy Justiss, and Logan Dougher) were duplicating a preselected website, savings multiplied page 2, using the Materialize framework. Materialize uses flex-box so that's what we primarily used. This framework does use a 12 column grid system. You need to label rows with a 'row' class.

## Installation

We imported the cooper-black text using @font-face but you need to have the file in your directory tree.


## Usage
1. Git clone 'url'
2. cd into the directory
3. Use http-server in your command line to serve.
